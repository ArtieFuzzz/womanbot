# woman bot

Woman Bot is a basic VIP Discord Bot I'm making.

Woman bot uses Slash Commands, and the source code will be public for all those who want to make their own.
 
To run woman bot on your own, download Node.js and the source code of this bot. Then, open a terminal window in the folder you just made and run `npm update` to download all the neccecary packages to run Woman Bot.

Then, setup your bot's Client ID, Token and Development Server Guild ID in config.json.

Invite Link for the official bot will be put in the readme when the bot is finished.
